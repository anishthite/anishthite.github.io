## Theory of Soul

### Soul is the largest indicator of success
- Founders are really good at an IC, this is the last thing they delegate, and the thing they have the highest bar in. The company tends to revolve around that bar (design, marketing, technical stuff)
- You have to set the bar high, you gotta set the tone
- If you dont enjoy the game or care about it in your heart it will show through in the product. Everyone can feel it
- Startups are emotional expressions
- Everything is downstream of desire/care, and you canâ€™t change that in someone
- You have to truly believe deep down that you will win
