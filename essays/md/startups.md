### Startups tend to emulate their founder’s mistakes
- If you hate meetings/delegation then your company default solution is to not have one (even though that may not the best solution)
- If you love meetings then your company culture will have too many
- The founder should be a focuser, not a diffuser, they shouldn’t lead to people getting more distracted/derailed
- CEO should be good at communicating things, expectations, emotions, employees should feel like if he’s giving it all then i should too


### Common Founder Mistakes:

#### Not making drastic changes
- Not sure on how to fix this, ig just keep on trying to make the biggest changes that I can

#### Not Moving Fast
- Employees should not have to be managed, they should be trusted to figure out the solutions to the problems
- I can be moving faster
- Stavan’s standup hack: you cant pull up if you didn’t do shit
    - Single player version: you can’t go home till you do something

#### Competitiveness
- Dont worry about what other people are doing
- Good ideas will spread anw
- Competitiveness results from insecurity in yourself/company, the way to fix that is to make yourself/your company more secure (build better)

#### Ppl making Mistakes	
- When people make mistakes you have to give them more chances to make the same mistakes (you have to still keep passing them the ball)
- You can’t get upset because then they will be scared to make mistakes, will worry more about that then trying to make the best steps

#### Shiny Objects:
- Don’t get distracted by shiny objects



### What sets good founders apart?
- They are in it for the love of the game
- They are really good at adapting to feedback
