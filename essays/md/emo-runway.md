Emotional runway is the #1 killer of startups, so it's important to figure out how it works.

## Some Observations

I've been hanging around [f.inc](https://f.inc) for a while now, and I've learnt some interesting things. 

A suprising learning is that financial runway is not what ends startups, emotional runway is. Emotional runway is how much desire you have to keep working on the startup. You can imagine it as a meter, kinda like a minecraft hunger bar.

As you build your startup and struggle, your emotional runway decreases. It's not a gradual decrease, it's more like a cliff. You don't notice it until it's too low, and by then it's too late. (Interestingly, this is also how thirst or sleep levels work, we don't notice them until we're at a certain threshold)

So what increases emotional runway? In short, growth. If you're growing, you're more likely to keep working on the startup. If you're not growing, you're more likely to give up. Unfortunately there's no other way. Taking a break won't help. It doesn't just need to be metrics. Framing things as a win helps too. At least for me, stagnation == losing emotional runway. It's not burnout, it's more like frustration that things aren't changing; I'm not moving forward at the pace I want to be
