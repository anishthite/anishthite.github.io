Emotional runway is the #1 killer of startups, so it's important to figure out how it works.

## Observations

- Emotional runway gradually decreases, but we perceive it to be like a cliff
- It's hard to notice until it drops too low, and then it's too late
  - Almost like thirst or sleep levels 
- The only solution to increasing emotional runway is winning
  - It doesn't just need to be metrics. Framing things as a win helps too 
- At least for me, stagnation == losing emotional runway
- It's not burnout, it's more like frustration that things aren't changing; I'm not moving forward at the pace I want to be
