            <br>
            <p>The way to succeed in a startup is not to be an expert on startups, but to be an expert on your users and the problem you're solving for them</p>
            <p>Live in the future and build what seems interesting</p> <br>
            <h2 id="ideas">Ideas:</h2>
            <p>fix stuff that's broken, make luxury a commodity (cheaper/easier)</p>
            <p>The best way to come up with startup ideas is to ask yourself the question: what do you wish someone would make for you?</p>
            <p>Pay particular attention to things that chafe you. The advantage of taking the status quo for granted is not just that it makes life (locally) more efficient, but also that it makes life more tolerable.</p>
            <p>&quot;Watch people who have money to spend, see what they're wasting their time on, cook up a solution, and try selling it to them. It's surprising how small a problem can be and still provide a profitable market for a solution.&quot;</p>
            <p>A lot of startups have that form: someone comes along and makes something for a tenth or a hundredth of what it used to cost, and the existing players can't follow because they don't even want to think about a world in which that's possible.</p>
            <p>When you have an idea for a startup, ask yourself: who wants this right now? Who wants this so much that they'll use it even when it's a crappy version one made by a two-person startup they've never heard of? If you can't answer that, the idea is probably bad.</p>
            <p>Startups are as impersonal as physics. You have to make something people want, and you prosper only to the extent you do.</p> <br>
            <h2 id="organics">Organics:</h2>
            <p>The best startups almost have to start as side projects, because great ideas tend to be such outliers that your conscious mind would reject them as ideas for companies.</p>
            <p>Being at the leading edge of a field doesn't mean you have to be one of the people pushing it forward. You can also be at the leading edge as a user. It was not so much because he was a programmer that Facebook seemed a good idea to Mark Zuckerberg as because he used computers so much. If you'd asked most 40 year olds in 2004 whether they'd like to publish their lives semi-publicly on the Internet, they'd have been horrified at the idea. But Mark already lived online; to him it seemed natural.</p>
            <p>Paul Buchheit says that people at the leading edge of a rapidly changing field &quot;live in the future.&quot; Combine that with Pirsig and you get:</p>
            <pre><code>Live in the future, then build what&#39;s missing. </code></pre>
            <p>That describes the way many if not most of the biggest startups got started. Neither Apple nor Yahoo nor Google nor Facebook were even supposed to be companies at first. They grew out of things their founders built because there seemed a gap in the world.</p>
            <p>Ok, so how do you turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in unconsciously? (1) Learn a lot about things that matter, then (2) work on problems that interest you (3) with people you like and respect. The third part, incidentally, is how you get cofounders at the same time as the idea.</p>
            <p>So one guaranteed way to turn your mind into the type that has good startup ideas is to get yourself to the leading edge of some technology — to cause yourself, as Paul Buchheit put it, to &quot;live in the future.&quot;</p>
            <p>I learnt never to bet on any one feature or deal or anything to bring you success. It is never a single thing. Everything is just incremental and you just have to keep doing lots of those things until you strike something.</p>
            <p>There is no such thing as a killer feature. Or at least you won't know what it is.</p>
            <p>There are ideas that obvious lying around now. The reason you're overlooking them is the same reason you'd have overlooked the idea of building Facebook in 2004: organic startup ideas usually don't seem like startup ideas at first.</p>
            <p>When Mark spoke at a YC dinner this winter he said he wasn't trying to start a company when he wrote the first version of Facebook. It was just a project. So was the Apple I when Woz first started working on it. He didn't think he was starting a company. If these guys had thought they were starting companies, they might have been tempted to do something more &quot;serious,&quot; and that would have been a mistake.</p>
            <p>Just fix things that seem broken, regardless of whether it seems like the problem is important enough to build a company on. If you keep pursuing such threads it would be hard not to end up making something of value to a lot of people, and when you do, surprise, you've got a company</p>
            <p>Just as trying to think up startup ideas tends to produce bad ones, working on things that could be dismissed as &quot;toys&quot; often produces good ones. When something is described as a toy, that means it has everything an idea needs except being important. It's cool; users love it; it just doesn't matter. But if you're living in the future and you build something cool that users love, it may matter more than outsiders think. Microcomputers seemed like toys when Apple and Microsoft started working on them. I'm old enough to remember that era; the usual term for people with their own microcomputers was &quot;hobbyists.&quot; BackRub seemed like an inconsequential science project. The Facebook was just a way for undergrads to stalk one another.</p><br>
            <h2 id="scaling">Scaling:</h2>
            <p>I was trying to think of a phrase to convey how extreme your attention to users should be, and I realized Steve Jobs had already done it: insanely great. Steve wasn't just using &quot;insanely&quot; as a synonym for &quot;very.&quot; He meant it more literally — that one should focus on quality of execution to a degree that in everyday life would be considered pathological.</p><br>
            <h2 id="encouragement">Encouragement</h2>
            <p>Don't be discouraged if what you produce initially is something other people dismiss as a toy. In fact, that's a good sign.</p>
            <p>PB made a point in a talk once that I now mention to every startup we fund: that it's better, initially, to make a small number of users really love you than a large number kind of like you. If I could tell startups only ten sentences, this would be one of them.</p>
            <p>It's very common for a group of founders to go through one lame idea before realizing that a startup has to make something people will pay for. In fact, we ourselves did.</p> <br>
            <h2 id="hackers">Hackers:</h2>
            <p>It is by poking about inside current technology that hackers get ideas for the next generation. No thanks, intellectual homeowners may say, we don't need any outside help. But they're wrong. The next generation of computer technology has often—perhaps more often than not—been developed by outsiders.</p>
            <p>Hackers are unruly. That is the essence of hacking.</p>
            <p>In 1977 there was no doubt some group within IBM developing what they expected to be the next generation of business computer. They were mistaken. The next generation of business computer was being developed on entirely different lines by two long-haired guys called Steve in a garage in Los Altos. At about the same time, the powers that be were cooperating to develop the official next generation operating system, Multics. But two guys who thought Multics excessively complex went off and wrote their own. They gave it a name that was a joking reference to Multics: Unix.</p>
            <p>&quot;The spirit of resistance to government,&quot; Jefferson wrote, &quot;is so valuable on certain occasions, that I wish it always to be kept alive.&quot;</p>
            <p>Imagine an American president saying that today. Like the remarks of an outspoken old grandmother, the sayings of the founding fathers have embarrassed generations of their less confident successors. They remind us where we come from. They remind us that it is the people who break rules that are the source of America's wealth and power.</p>
