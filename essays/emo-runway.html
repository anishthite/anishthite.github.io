# On emotional runway

Emotional runway is the #1 killer of startups, so It’s important to figure out how it works.


Some observations:
- Emotional runway gradually decreases, but we perceive it to be like a cliff
- It’s hard to notice until it drops too low, and then it’s too late
    - Almost like thirst or sleep levels 
- The only solution to increasing emotional runway is winning.
    - It doesn’t just need to be metrics. Framing things as a win help too 
- At least for me stagnation == losing emotional runway
- It’s not burnout, its more like frustration hat things aren’t changing, I’m not moving forward at the pace I want to be
